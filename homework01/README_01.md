This homework assignment utilizes a dictionary located in /usr/share/dict/words in the coe-332 class machine as well as a python function called names. With names you can get a first, last, female, male, full name. Script01.py finds the five longest words from the words file. Script02.py prints out five first names that are exactly eight characters (nine including space). Script03.py uses the names function to generate a list of five full names and prints out the name as well as the number of characters minus spaces. A function is defined to determine the length.
