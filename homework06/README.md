# Vehicle CO2 Emissions By Year

## What is this and Why is it Important?
### About the Data
This [data](https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data#DetailedData) (table A-1) is collected by the EPA and NHTSA from light-duty vehicle manufacturers annually to determine the fuel efficiency and carbon footprint of vehicles. Vehicles are categorized by the regulatory class (car or truck), then further organized into vehicle type (Sedan/Wagon, Car SUV, Truck SUV, Minivan/Van, Pickup). Data labeled preliminary is estimation and final numbers have not been recorded for that year yet. Data about the automotive industry's CO2 emissions and fuel economy is critical to the sustainability of transportation as concerns of climate change and environmental pollution rise. This program is meant to aid consumers in making purchase decisions when it comes to vehicles by providing them with the environmental and fuel economy data of certain car manufacturers. 
### Contents of this Repository
This repository contains: Dockerfile, this README.md, auto_trends_app.py, and docker-compose.yml. The python script accesses the data and contains all necessary Flask routes for the user to run. The Dockerfile containerizes the flask program so that the program can be run and distributed efficiently. The docker-compose.yml brings together the flask and redis components so the program can be initiated in a few short lines of code.  
## Cloning the Git Repository
Starting from this [repository](https://github.com/amymanning1/my-coe-332-hws), the user should click the green code button, ensure
the link is set to SSH then copy the link. Switching to the command line, the
user will type`git clone git@github.com:amymanning1/my-coe-332-hws.git`
Cloning a Git repository is essentially copying that repo that is available online to a userâ€™s personal system. For this specific program, you will be using 'homework06'.
## How To Access and Download Data
From [this](https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data#DetailedData) page, scroll towards the bottom of the page until you see table A-1. Click A-1 on the sidebar and once the data set is selected, click the blue rectangular export button above the table. Save this data in a place easily accessible to your local computer and name it `auto-trends-manufacturer.csv`. In your local terminal, secure copy this data over to the class TACC page or whatever secured medium you want to transport your data to by the following command: `[local]$ scp data.csv username@login-coe332.tacc.utexas.edu:~/`
Then, to copy this to your virtual machine, do this: `scp username@login-coe332.tacc.utexas.edu:~/data.csv ./`. From there, copy the raw data into the same directory where this repo is cloned.
## Getting the Docker Image
### Pull the Image from Docker
To pull this image from Docker Hub, type `docker pull amymanning1/auto_trends_app:1.0` in your command line. Ensure you are in the same directory as `auto_trends_app.py`.
### Build a New Image from the Dockerfile
To build a new image using the existing Dockerfile in this repo, `docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/auto_trends_app:1.0 .` filling in the <> with your Docker Hub username. Check that the image built using `docker images`. You will have to rebuild the image using the above command any time you change the python app or Dockerfile. 
## Launch the Containerized App & Redis
To launch the program, the safest bet is to follow this line of commands:
1. `docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/auto_trends_app:1.0 .` This does not necessarily have to be done everytime, however if you think changes were made, it's better to be safe and rebuild. 
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. `some curl command` (examples in next section) This is where the user accesses the data
4. Once you are ready to close the container, `docker-compose down` shuts everything down so that nothing is running in the background. 
## Example Queries and Outputs
* `curl localhost:5000/data` returns the entire data set (hundreds of dictionaries like this one)

* `curl -X POST localhost:5000/data` adds the data to a redis database
	- **Example Output**: `data loaded into redis`
* `curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/data` deletes all the data from the redis database
	- **Example Output**: `data deleted, there are len([]) keys in the db`
* `curl localhost:5000/years` returns a list of all the years recorded in the dataset. 
	- **Example Output**: `[
